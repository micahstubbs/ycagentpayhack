# Welcome to Embedded Wallets

## Overview

With Embedded Wallets, your users can access the full power of blockchains through familiar authentication methods like email and social logins (no seed phrases, browser extensions, or pop-ups required).

Built on Coinbase's trusted infrastructure, they enable users to interact with blockchain applications without the complexity of traditional wallet management.

## Security and compliance

Embedded Wallets leverage CDP's advanced security infrastructure to provide true self-custody with enterprise-grade protection:

- **Advanced security architecture**: All cryptographic operations occur within secure, isolated environments that even Coinbase cannot access
- **Temporary Wallet Secrets**: Device-specific cryptographic keys are generated and stored locally on users' devices, never exposed to Coinbase
- **True self-custody**: Unlike traditional MPC solutions, our approach ensures faster operations while maintaining user control
- **Multi-device support**: Users can securely access their wallet from up to 5 different devices

This architecture combines the convenience of embedded wallets with the security guarantees of self-custodial solutions, ensuring your users maintain full control of their assets. Learn more in [Security & Export](/embedded-wallets/security-export).
